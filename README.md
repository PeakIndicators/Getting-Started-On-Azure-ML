# Getting Started On Azure Machine Learning Studio

Before getting into detail on how to work with Azure Machine Learning Studio (azure ML Studio), let's introduce what is the tool for. 

## What is machine learning?
Machine learning is a data science technique that allows computers to use existing data to forecast future behaviors, outcomes, and trends. By using machine learning, computers learn without being explicitly programmed. Forecasts or predictions from machine learning can make apps and devices smarter. 

## How can we perform machine learning tasks in Azure?
Among others, Azure has a resource called: Azure Machine Learning Studio, which is the web portal for data scientist developers in Azure Machine Learning. The studio combines no-code and code-first experiences for an inclusive data science platform.

With this in mind, the main purpose of this repository, is to establish a guide on how to get started with Azure Machine Learning Studio.

The ultimate goal is to provide a guide on:

* How to author machine learning projects in the studio.
* How to manage assets and resources in the studio.

We recommend the use of the most up-to-date browser that's compatible with your operating system. The following browsers are supported:

* Microsoft Edge (The new Microsoft Edge, latest version. Not Microsoft Edge legacy)
* Safari (latest version, Mac only)
* Chrome (latest version)
* Firefox (latest version)

We will also re-use some of Microsoft documentation (see: https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/machine-learning/) on the subject but we will try to present it in a structured way. This repo contains snippets of code and notebooks that you will be able to run in your own time. All the code used in this repo is shown in Python unless specifiied otheriwse.
