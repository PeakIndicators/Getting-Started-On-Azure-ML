# Detect data drift on datasets

## What is data drift?
The variety of data sources and quick innovation in advanced analytics, data science, AI and machine learning has fundamentally changed the scale and pace of data integration. The added pressure to make decisions quickly in unprecedented times means that your organization is more dependent on fresh, reliable data than ever before. 

Data drift is unexpected and undocumented changes to data structure, semantics and infrastructure. Data drift breaks processes and corrupts data but can also reveal new opportunities for data use.

Data drift is one of the top reasons model accuracy degrades over time. For machine learning models, data drift is the change in model input data that leads to model performance degradation. Monitoring data drift helps detect these model performance issues.

Causes of data drift include:

* Process changes. Example: a sensor being replaced that changes the units of measurement from inches to centimeters.
* Data quality issues
* Natural drift in the data. Example:mean temperature changing with the seasons.
* Change in relation between features.

Azure Machine Learning simplifies drift detection by computing a single metric, abstracting the complexity of datasets being compared. These datasets may have hundreds of features and a lot of rows. But once drift is detected, you drill down into which features are causing the drift. You then inspect feature level metrics to debug and isolate the root cause for the drift. This top down approach makes it easy to monitor data instead of traditional rules-based techniques. 

Azure Machine Learning, uses **dataset monitors** to detect and alert for data drift:

* Analyze drift in the data to understand how it changes over time.
* Monitor model data for differences between training and serving datasets. 
* Monitor new data for differences between any baseline and target dataset.
* Profile features in data to track how statistical properties change over time.
* Set up alerts on data drift for early warnings to potential issues. Custom alerting can be set up on all metrics generated by the monitor through Azure Application Insights.

## Dataset monitors
Dataset monitors depend on the following Azure services.

|Azure service	|Description|
|------------|-----------|
|Dataset	| Drift uses Machine Learning datasets to retrieve training data and compare data for model training. Generating profile of data is used to generate some of the reported metrics such as min, max, distinct values, distinct values count.|
|Azureml pipeline and compute|	The drift calculation job is hosted in azureml pipeline. The job is triggered on demand or by schedule to run on a compute configured at drift monitor creation time.|
|Application insights|	Drift emits metrics to Application Insights belonging to the machine learning workspace.|
|Azure blob storage|	Drift emits metrics in json format to Azure blob storage.|

### Baseline and target datasets
The first step to define a Dataset Monitor is to define:

* Baseline dataset - usually the training dataset for a model.
* Target dataset - usually model input data - is compared over time to your baseline dataset. This comparison means that your target dataset must have a timestamp column specified.

The monitor will compare the baseline and target datasets.

#### Create target dataset
The target dataset needs the timeseries trait set on it by specifying the timestamp column either from a column in the data or a virtual column derived from the path pattern of the files. 

_Creating a target Dataset using Azure Machine Learning Studio Notebooks with Python_

The Dataset class with_timestamp_columns() method defines the time stamp column for the dataset.

```
from azureml.core import Workspace, Dataset, Datastore

# get workspace object
ws = Workspace.from_config()

# get datastore object 
dstore = Datastore.get(ws, 'your datastore name')

# specify datastore paths
dstore_paths = [(dstore, 'weather/*/*/*/*/data.parquet')]

# specify partition format
partition_format = 'weather/{state}/{date:yyyy/MM/dd}/data.parquet'

# create the Tabular dataset with 'state' and 'date' as virtual columns 
dset = Dataset.Tabular.from_parquet_files(path=dstore_paths, partition_format=partition_format)

# assign the timestamp attribute to a real or virtual column in the dataset
dset = dset.with_timestamp_columns('date')

# register the dataset as the target dataset
dset = dset.register(ws, 'target')
```

_Creating a Target Dataset using Azure Machine Learning Studio Create Dataset UI_

If you create your dataset using Azure Machine Learning studio, ensure the path to your data contains timestamp information, include all subfolders with data, and set the partition format.

In the following example, all data under the subfolder NoaaIsdFlorida/2019 is taken and the partition format specifies the timestamp's year, month, and day.

In the **Schema** settings, specify the timestamp column from a virtual or real column in the specified dataset:

If your data is partitioned by date, as is the case here, you can also specify the partition_timestamp.

#### Create dataset monitor
Create a dataset monitor to detect and alert to data drift on a new dataset.

_Creating a Dataset Monitor using Azure Machine Learning Studio Notebooks with Python_

```
from azureml.core import Workspace, Dataset
from azureml.datadrift import DataDriftDetector
from datetime import datetime

# get the workspace object
ws = Workspace.from_config()

# get the target dataset
dset = Dataset.get_by_name(ws, 'target')

# set the baseline dataset
baseline = target.time_before(datetime(2019, 2, 1))

# set up feature list
features = ['latitude', 'longitude', 'elevation', 'windAngle', 'windSpeed', 'temperature', 'snowDepth', 'stationName', 'countryOrRegion']

# set up data drift detector
monitor = DataDriftDetector.create_from_datasets(ws, 'drift-monitor', baseline, target, 
                                                      compute_target='cpu-cluster', 
                                                      frequency='Week', 
                                                      feature_list=None, 
                                                      drift_threshold=.6, 
                                                      latency=24)

# get data drift detector by name
monitor = DataDriftDetector.get_by_name(ws, 'drift-monitor')

# update data drift detector
monitor = monitor.update(feature_list=features)

# run a backfill for January through May
backfill1 = monitor.backfill(datetime(2019, 1, 1), datetime(2019, 5, 1))

# run a backfill for May through today
backfill1 = monitor.backfill(datetime(2019, 5, 1), datetime.today())

# disable the pipeline schedule for the data drift detector
monitor = monitor.disable_schedule()

# enable the pipeline schedule for the data drift detector
monitor = monitor.enable_schedule()
```

* Select target dataset. The target dataset is a tabular dataset with timestamp column specified which will be analyzed for data drift. The target dataset must have features in common with the baseline dataset, and should be a timeseries dataset, which new data is appended to. Historical data in the target dataset can be analyzed, or new data can be monitored.

* Select baseline dataset. Select the tabular dataset to be used as the baseline for comparison of the target dataset over time. The baseline dataset must have features in common with the target dataset. Select a time range to use a slice of the target dataset, or specify a separate dataset to use as the baseline.

* Monitor settings. These settings are for the scheduled dataset monitor pipeline, which will be created.

Understand data drift results
This section shows you the results of monitoring a dataset, found in the Datasets / Dataset monitors page in Azure studio. You can update the settings as well as analyze existing data for a specific time period on this page.

Start with the top-level insights into the magnitude of data drift and a highlight of features to be further investigated.

Drift overview

UNDERSTAND DATA DRIFT RESULTS
Metric	Description
Data drift magnitude	A percentage of drift between the baseline and target dataset over time. Ranging from 0 to 100, 0 indicates identical datasets and 100 indicates the Azure Machine Learning data drift model can completely tell the two datasets apart. Noise in the precise percentage measured is expected due to machine learning techniques being used to generate this magnitude.
Top drifting features	Shows the features from the dataset that have drifted the most and are therefore contributing the most to the Drift Magnitude metric. Due to covariate shift, the underlying distribution of a feature does not necessarily need to change to have relatively high feature importance.
Threshold	Data Drift magnitude beyond the set threshold will trigger alerts. This can be configured in the monitor settings.
Drift magnitude trend
See how the dataset differs from the target dataset in the specified time period. The closer to 100%, the more the two datasets differ.

Drift magnitude trend

Drift magnitude by features
This section contains feature-level insights into the change in the selected feature's distribution, as well as other statistics, over time.

The target dataset is also profiled over time. The statistical distance between the baseline distribution of each feature is compared with the target dataset's over time. Conceptually, this is similar to the data drift magnitude. However this statistical distance is for an individual feature rather than all features. Min, max, and mean are also available.

In the Azure Machine Learning studio, click on a bar in the graph to see the the feature level details for that date. By default, you see the baseline dataset's distribution and the most recent run's distribution of the same feature.

Drift magnitude by features

These metrics can also be retrieved in the Python SDK through the get_metrics() method on a DataDriftDetector object.

Feature details
Finally, scroll down to view details for each individual feature. Use the dropdowns above the chart to select the feature, and additionally select the metric you want to view.

Numeric feature graph and comparison

Metrics in the chart depend on the type of feature.

Numeric features

TABLE 5
Metric	Description
Wasserstein distance	Minimum amount of work to transform baseline distribution into the target distribution.
Mean value	Average value of the feature.
Min value	Minimum value of the feature.
Max value	Maximum value of the feature.
Categorical features

TABLE 6
Metric	Description
Euclidian distance     	  Computed for categorical columns. Euclidean distance is computed on two vectors, generated from empirical distribution of the same categorical column from two datasets. 0 indicates there is no difference in the empirical distributions.  The more it deviates from 0, the more this column has drifted. Trends can be observed from a time series plot of this metric and can be helpful in uncovering a drifting feature.  
Unique values	Number of unique values (cardinality) of the feature.
On this chart, select a single date to compare the feature distribution between the target and this date for the displayed feature. For numeric features, this shows two probability distributions. If the feature is numeric, a bar chart is shown.

Select a date to compare to target

Metrics, alerts, and events
Metrics can be queried in the Azure Application Insights resource associated with your machine learning workspace. You have access to all features of Application Insights including set up for custom alert rules and action groups to trigger an action such as, an Email/SMS/Push/Voice or Azure Function. Refer to the complete Application Insights documentation for details.

To get started, navigate to the Azure portal and select your workspace's Overview page. The associated Application Insights resource is on the far right:

Azure portal overview

Select Logs (Analytics) under Monitoring on the left pane:

Application insights overview

The dataset monitor metrics are stored as customMetrics. You can write and run a query after setting up a dataset monitor to view them:

Log analytics query

After identifying metrics to set up alert rules, create a new alert rule:

New alert rule

You can use an existing action group, or create a new one to define the action to be taken when the set conditions are met:

New action group

Troubleshooting
Limitations and known issues for data drift monitors:

The time range when analyzing historical data is limited to 31 intervals of the monitor's frequency setting.

Limitation of 200 features, unless a feature list is not specified (all features used).

Compute size must be large enough to handle the data.

Ensure your dataset has data within the start and end date for a given monitor run.

Dataset monitors will only work on datasets that contain 50 rows or more.

Columns, or features, in the dataset are classified as categorical or numeric based on the conditions in the following table. If the feature does not meet these conditions - for instance, a column of type string with >100 unique values - the feature is dropped from our data drift algorithm, but is still profiled.

TABLE 7
Feature type	Data type	Condition	Limitations
Categorical	string, bool, int, float	The number of unique values in the feature is less than 100 and less than 5% of the number of rows.	Null is treated as its own category.
Numerical	int, float	The values in the feature are of a numerical data type and do not meet the condition for a categorical feature.	Feature dropped if >15% of values are null.
When you have created a data drift monitor but cannot see data on the Dataset monitors page in Azure Machine Learning studio, try the following.

Check if you have selected the right date range at the top of the page.
On the Dataset Monitors tab, select the experiment link to check run status. This link is on the far right of the table.
If run completed successfully, check driver logs to see how many metrics has been generated or if there's any warning messages. Find driver logs in the Output + logs tab after you click on an experiment.
If the SDK backfill() function does not generate the expected output, it may be due to an authentication issue. When you create the compute to pass into this function, do not use Run.get_context().experiment.workspace.compute_targets. Instead, use ServicePrincipalAuthentication such as the following to create the compute that you pass into that backfill() function:

Python

Copy
auth = ServicePrincipalAuthentication(
        tenant_id=tenant_id,
        service_principal_id=app_id,
        service_principal_password=client_secret
        )
ws = Workspace.get("xxx", auth=auth, subscription_id="xxx", resource_group"xxx")
compute = ws.compute_targets.get("xxx")
From the Model Data Collector, it can take up to (but usually less than) 10 minutes for data to arrive in your blob storage account. In a script or Notebook, wait 10 minutes to ensure cells below will run.

Python

Copy
import time
time.sleep(600)
