# Anaconda (conda)

## Getting started with conda
Conda is a powerful package manager and environment manager that you use with command line commands at the Anaconda Prompt for Windows or in a terminal window for macOS or Linux.

## Installing on Windows

1) [Download the Anaconda installer](https://www.anaconda.com/products/individual#windows)

2) Double click the installer to launch.

**Note**—To prevent permission errors, do not launch the installer from the [Favorites folder](https://docs.anaconda.com/anaconda/user-guide/troubleshooting/#distro-troubleshooting-favorites-folder).


**Note**—If you encounter issues during installation, temporarily disable your anti-virus software during install, then re-enable it after the installation concludes. If you installed for all users, uninstall Anaconda and re-install it for your user only and try again.

3) Click **Next** 
&nbsp;
4) Read the licensing terms and click **“I Agree”**.
&nbsp;
5) Select an install for **“Just Me”** unless you’re installing for all users (which requires **Windows Administrator privileges**) and click **Next**.
&nbsp;
6) Select a destination folder to install Anaconda and click **Next**. See [FAQ](https://docs.anaconda.com/anaconda/user-guide/faq/#distribution-faq-windows-folder).

**Note**—Install Anaconda to a directory path that does not contain spaces or unicode characters.

**Note**—Do not install as Administrator unless admin privileges are required.

7) Choose whether to add Anaconda to your PATH environment variable. Adding Anaconda to the PATH environment variable is not recommended since this can interfere with other software. Instead, use Anaconda software by opening Anaconda Navigator or the Anaconda Prompt from the Start Menu as shown in the images above. 
&nbsp;
8) Choose whether to register Anaconda as your default Python. Unless you plan on installing and running multiple versions of Anaconda or multiple versions of Python, accept the default and leave this box checked.
&nbsp;
9) Click **Install**. If you want to watch the packages Anaconda is installing, click Show Details.
&nbsp;
10) Click **Next**.
