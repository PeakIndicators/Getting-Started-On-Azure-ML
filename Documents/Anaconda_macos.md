# Anaconda (conda)

## Getting started with conda
Conda is a powerful package manager and environment manager that you use with command line commands at the Anaconda Prompt for Windows, or in a terminal window for macOS or Linux.

## Installing on macOS

You can install Anaconda using either the graphical installer (“wizard”) or the command line (“manual”). The instructions below detail how to install using the graphical installer. If you prefer using a terminal window refer to this [page](https://docs.anaconda.com/anaconda/install/mac-os/#using-the-command-line-install).
### macOS graphical install
